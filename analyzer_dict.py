# The keys in regex_patterns and solutions should be exactly the same
# Formatting:
#   - Please do not use <variable> in the solution as it will be considered as html tags and will not be displayed rather use $variable
#       Example: Instead of `grep <log-message> logfile` use `grep $log-message logfile`
